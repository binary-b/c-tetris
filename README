Filip Jagiellowicz 2064758, winter term project (C begginer Course)

The most interesting part of this project is class interface (classes,
objects, interfaces along with inherietance) implementation in pure C.

The most important classes are described in their header files.
Alongside with this project git repository have been created. Looking
in 'git log' may help understanding the project inself.
The file 'debug.h' contains useful macros which may help tracking
the program execution.

In the folder 'docs' is an image of all classes explaining how they
are related to each others.

'*.r' files are 'private headers' - they contains informations on
implementation. They should not included when not needed in order to
follow information hidding programming pattern.

The project is finally aimed at creating short and redable library/
frame work which will provide simple, most common classes without
restricting user.

Compiling:
  - install all required dependences
  - run 'make clobber && make'
  - start application with './calculator'

Used libraries (dependences):
  - standarc C library (GNU version)
  - allegro 5.2.3-2
